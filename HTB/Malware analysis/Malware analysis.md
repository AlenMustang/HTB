## Static Analysis

Malware is analyzed without being executed. 
We check different properties of the PE file. Malware often uses obfuscation to avoid detection such as packing or opther means of hidint its properties.

## Dynamic analysis

While static analysis is a good start to analyzing a malicious file with dynamic analysis we can study what the malware does when it is detonated.

We perform dynamic analysis in a higly controlled evnirment to reduce the noise of other services on our analysis.

## Examining the file type

```shell
file wannacry 
wannacry: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Windows

```
